This file contains information related to installation of muwave.

The use of the '$' symbol denotes the MATLAB prompt.

System Requirements
-------------------
- MATLAB (any modern version should work, tested on 2007 and later)
- C/C++ compiler
  - LCC works on Windows 32-bit platforms (ships with MATLAB)
  - Microsoft Visual C/C++ on Windows 64-bit platforms (other compilers might work, not tested)
  - gcc on Linux 32- and 64-bit platforms
  - For mor details on supported compilers see MATLAB documentation on MEX.
- (OPTIONAL) Instrument Control Toolbox
- (OPTIONAL) Optimization Toolbox

Directory Structure
-------------------
muwave (main directory)
	- doc (freeda PDF documentation)
	- gui (contains GUI code)
	- ictrl (contains instrument drivers and supporting code)
	- utils (contains generic functions)
	- @arraymatrix (class for handling large arrays of matrices)
	- mex (contains supporting C-code for the @arraymatrix class)
	- @xparam (class for operating on S-,Z-,Y-,ABCD-,T-parameters)
	- @mna (minimal frequency domain linear circuit simulator with sensitivity analysis)
	- @waveform (class for operating on harmonic waveforms e.g. large signal network analyzer data)
	- @meassp (class for operating on measured S-parameter data)
	- @meassweep (class for operating on multiple measured S-parameter data)
	- @measdc (class for operating on DC measurements)
	- @measmnt (generic class for measurements)
	- @measnoise (class for operating on noise parameter measurements)
	- @modelsp (class for operating on modeled S-parameters)
	- @measstate (class for handling bias, temperature information)
	- @measwf (class for operating on measured waveforms)
	

Installation of muwave
-------------------------------
Installation of muwave is a two part process.

1. COMPILING AND INSTALLING MEX-FILES
Make sure that you can compile the mex example provided by MathWorks (yprime.c). See the MATLAB documentation (Run "doc mex" at the MATLAB prompt).

1a) In the MATLAB command window, change directory to "<path_to_muwave_directory>/mex". 

The next two steps are only necessary on Windows platforms. For other platforms (Linux, OS X) go directly to step 1d)

1b) Open the supplied "mexify.m" file in the MATLAB-editor.

1c) Verify that the path to the BLAS and LAPACK-libraries are correct. This path will depend on your Windows version and compiler.
    Example 1: 32-bit Windows and LCC-compiler:
        path_lapack = sprintf('%s/extern/lib/win32/%s/libmwlapack.lib %s/extern/lib/win32/%s/libmwblas.lib',matlabroot,'lcc',matlabroot,'lcc');
    Example 2: 64-bit Windows and Microsoft Visual C compiler:
        path_lapack = sprintf('%s/extern/lib/win64/%s/libmwlapack.lib %s/extern/lib/win64/%s/libmwblas.lib','C:\PROGRA~1\MATLAB\R2009A\','microsoft','C:\PROGRA~1\MATLAB\R2009A\','microsoft');
    Note: some of the mex-tools don't like spaces in the paths. In such cases it is necessary to use shorthand for the directorys (e.g. "PROGRA~1" instead of "Program Files").  

1d) Run "mexify.m"

1e) Verify that the compiled mex-files are located in  "<path_to_muwave_directory>/@arraymatrix/private". 

1f) If the compilation fails miserably, muwave ships with some pre-compiled mex-files in "<path_to_muwave_directory>/mex/bin". 

2. ADD MUWAVE TO THE PATH

The following directories must be visible on the MATLAB path:

    <path_to_muwave_directory>/
    <path_to_muwave_directory>/utils
    <path_to_muwave_directory>/ictrl
    <path_to_muwave_directory>/gui

This can be done via the File/Set Path... menu in MATLAB. 

3. TEST THE INSTALLATION

Verify the installation by writing the following commands at the MATLAB prompt:

>> A=arraymatrix(randn(4,4,11))
arraymatrix-object
	 dimension:	 4 x 4
	 elements:	 11

First matrix element:
    0.0675    0.3929   -0.7745    1.9278
   -0.1871    0.1946    0.7868   -0.1762
    0.2917    0.2798    1.4089   -0.2438
    0.9877    0.0512   -0.5341   -0.8976

>> (A+A-A)\A
arraymatrix-object
	 dimension:	 4 x 4
	 elements:	 11

First matrix element:
    1.0000    0.0000    0.0000    0.0000
    0.0000    1.0000    0.0000   -0.0000
         0    0.0000    1.0000   -0.0000
         0    0.0000    0.0000    1.0000
